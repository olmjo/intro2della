# Intro to Della: Basic HPC at Princeton University
- Author: Jonathan Olmsted


## Abstract
The purpose of this documentation is to introduce users to interacting with the
HPC resources at Princeton University. Topics covered include local-remote file
management, submitting jobs, and viewing job progress. The coverage applies to
serial and parallel jobs. Although parallelization is not covered explicitly,
nearly all of the material covered can be understood without any experience in
parallelizing codes.
